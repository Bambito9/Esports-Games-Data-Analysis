# Esports-Data-Analysis

The phenomenon of e-sports (electronic sports) has been growing and, with it, so has the interest in online video games by players and spectators. With the technological evolution it has become increasingly easier to use data collection techniques about the events that take place during a game, generating large volumes of data that can be used to analyze the performance of players and teams. This type of analysis is of great importance in both personal and professional contexts. Casual players look for methods to understand what mistakes they are making and the optimal way to play certain characters, while in a professional context, the focus is mostly on understanding what strategies are used by other teams and how to counter them. 

For the analysis of this volume of data to be effective it is fundamental to explore data analysis mechanisms combined with visualization techniques (analytical visualization) applied to spatio-temporal data and to the various types of events during a match that are of interest to players, coaches and analysts. These events can range from a player's position (space) at a given instant (time), to more game-specific events, such as the position where the player died.

The goal of this proposal is to continue the work on analytical visualization of video games by exploring new datasets and new data analysis techniques. It is intended to explore and apply machine learning algorithms on the spatio-temporal data in order to discover and predict regular player behaviors, among others. This analysis will be done using ML libraries, such as Phyton's scikit-learn. The accomplishment of the work assumes knowledge about machine learning algorithms.
